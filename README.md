# Pokémon Shuffler

A Pokémon randomizer for NDS and higher games (generation IV and up).

Currently it doesn't do much at all. Randomization goals:

* wild pokémon
* trainer pokémon
  * optionally type-themed
* color palettes
  * pokémon
  * pokéballs
  * trainer sprites
* learnsets
* level-ups
  * Allow for a random number of level-up methods (instead of just shuffling existing level-ups)
  * Interesting level-up modes: monophyletic, monophyletic types, type-consistent
* trainer classes
* trainer names
  * with consistency in dialogue
* gender ratios
* types

Quality of life goals:

* remove trade level-ups
* remove "while knowing move X" level-ups
* generate a guide to the pokémon game that shows

Silliness:

* silly trainer class names
* silly dialogue

We'll have both command line and GUI versions.
